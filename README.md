**A metric-preserving bijection between arithmetic invariants of elliptic curves over ℚ and topological invariants of the cosmic web.**

### Formal Statement
---
**Arithmetic–Cosmic Structure Conjecture (ACSC):**  

There exists a metric-preserving bijection  

 𝛟: A → T

between the arithmetic class of an elliptic curve E/ℚ (rank (r), regulator (R), real period (Omega(𝛀)), discriminant (Delta(Δ)), conductor (N)) and the topological class of cosmic structures (Betti numbers \(beta_k), curvature scalars, persistence entropy strata), such that the map preserves the natural metrics on both sides and is dynamically stabilized by the **Complexity-14 Symbolic Action Principle**.

### Core Components

- **Arithmetic side**: Rank, regulator, real period, discriminant, conductor (Cremona + LMFDB)
- **Cosmic side**: Betti numbers, persistence entropy, topological invariants of the cosmic web
- **Symbolic Action Principle**: Complexity-14 equation (derived via PySR) + SFT potential enforcing Arithmetic Scarcity and rank–Betti correspondence
- **Validation**: Full 3-Selmer evidence (Sage + PARI), Complexity-14 filtering, scarcity analysis

### Current Empirical Results (as of April 2026)

- **Total curves analyzed**: 102,673 (38,042 Cremona + 64,631 LMFDB)
- **Complexity-14 pass rate**: **74.28%** (76,270 curves dynamically stable)
- **Sage/PARI rank consistency**: **99.8%**
- **Arithmetic Scarcity trend**: Higher algebraic rank correlates with systematically smaller average \(\log_{10}|\Delta|\)

### Repository Structure

- `data/raw/` – Cremona and LMFDB raw exports
- `data/processed/` – 3-Selmer estimates with full PARI data
- `scripts/` – Batch processing pipelines (memory-safe, resumable)
- `notebooks/` – Exploratory analysis and Complexity-14 fitting
- `acsc/` – Core Python package for the conjecture
