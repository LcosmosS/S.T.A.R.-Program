## S.T.A.R. — Symbolic Topoloical Arithmetic Relativity
---

A unified mathematical and theoretical physics framework that proposes the large-scale structure of the cosmos is predetermined by the arithmetic invariants of elliptic curves over ℚ, dynamically conserved through entropy cohomology, and realized as an effective relativistic cosmology.

### Core Idea

The physical universe operates as the ultimate Symbolic Field: a self-consistent projection of deep number-theoretic structures. Fundamental physical constants and the geometry of the cosmic web emerge not from chance or anthropic selection, but from number-theoretic necessity.

### Trilogy Architecture

- **ACSC — Arithmetic–Cosmic Structure Conjecture (Geometry)**
A metric-preserving projection map $\Phi: \mathcal{E} \to M_{\rm cosmo}$ from elliptic curves $E/\mathbb{Q}$ to 3D cosmic geometry.
Uses bounded normalizations of the discriminant $\Delta_E$, conductor $N_E$, rank $r_E$, regulator, and real period $\Omega_E$.

- **ECC — Entropy Cohomology Conjecture (Dynamics)**
Introduces an entropy field $\mathcal{M}(x)$ and cohomology framework that enforces conservation laws and provides the dynamical stability for the arithmetic projection.

- **S.T.A.R. — Unified Cosmology**
Synthesizes the above into an effective relativistic theory. Key innovation:
Scale-dependent effective Hubble parameter $H_{\rm eff}(z) = H_0 \cdot \langle \Omega_E \rangle_z$$where $\langle \Omega_E \rangle_z$ is a weighted average over the projected point cloud $\{\Phi(E)\}$, with weights determined by projection distortions, isogeny class density, and local-versus-global sampling.
This naturally produces different effective expansion rates at late times (local distance ladder, $\sim 72{-}74$ km/s/Mpc) versus early times (CMB, $\sim 67.4$ km/s/Mpc), offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension through arithmetic self-tuning.

### Key Innovations

- **Global-to-Local Mapping Paradox Correction (GLMPCT):**
    Dynamic topological corrections (sinusoidal, oblate flattening, force-directed repulsion) that preserve metric structure.

- **Symbolic Action Principle:**
    Derived via symbolic regression on topological and arithmetic features.

- **Testable Predictions:**
    Persistent homology of the arithmetic point cloud compared to CMB anomalies (low quadrupole suppression, hemispherical asymmetry, low-multipole alignment).

- **Inverse Mapping:**
    Recover arithmetic rank from cosmological observables via $  \rho_{\rm obs} \to r_E  $.
