# S.M.A.T. 
# S.T.A.R. Mission Analysis Tool

## Vision

**S.M.A.T.** (S.T.A.R. Mission Analysis Tool) is the applied mission-planning and operations component of the S.T.A.R. Program. Inspired by NASA’s **General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT)**, S.M.A.T. leverages the underlying **Symbolic Field** model — arithmetic projections (ACSC), entropy cohomology (ECC), and symbolic dynamics — to provide a next-generation framework for interplanetary and interstellar mission design, optimization, and real-time decision support.

S.M.A.T. treats spacetime not as a passive background but as an active **arithmetic-symbolic manifold**. Mission trajectories, communication windows, gravitational assists, and risk assessments are informed by the same number-theoretic structures that govern cosmic large-scale structure.

## Core Objectives

- Enable high-fidelity trajectory optimization using the scale-dependent effective Hubble parameter $\(H_{\rm eff}(z)\)$ and arithmetic density fields.
- Incorporate topological stability metrics (persistent homology) for route planning through cosmic voids and filaments.
- Predict communication reliability using entropy cohomology gradients.
- Support both conventional interplanetary missions and speculative interstellar concepts by modeling propagation through the Symbolic Field.
- Provide an open, extensible platform that bridges fundamental theoretical physics with practical space exploration.

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Trajectory Design & Optimization**: Support high-thrust, low-thrust, and gravity-assist trajectories with symbolic weighting from the projected point cloud $\(\{\Phi(E)\}\)$.
- **Scale-Dependent Cosmology**: Use $\(H_{\rm eff}(z)\)$ for accurate long-duration ephemeris and deep-space navigation.
- **Topological Routing**: Avoid or exploit stable/unstable topological features (filaments as “highways”, voids as low-density corridors) based on persistent homology.
- **Communication Analysis**: Model signal propagation delays, attenuation, and reliability using entropy density fields and local Betti numbers.
- **Risk Assessment**: Quantify mission risk via arithmetic scarcity, topological complexity, and entropy gradients along the trajectory.
- **Visualization**: 3D/4D interactive maps integrating cosmic structure with mission paths (integrated with S.T.A.R.M.A.P.).

### Technical Requirements
- Interoperability with existing tools (GMAT, SPICE, Astropy, Blender).
- Support for symbolic regression-derived laws for custom force models.
- Modular architecture allowing easy addition of new physics (e.g., modified gravity from the elliptic curve bundle).
- Reproducible and open-source (Python + SageMath core, with C++/GPU acceleration options).

## Initial Design Architecture

### Core Modules
- **`smat/core/`** — Trajectory propagator using $\(H_{\rm eff}(z)\)$ and arithmetic scalar fields.
- **`smat/optimization/`** — Multi-objective optimizer (fuel, time, risk, communication) incorporating symbolic weights.
- **`smat/topology/`** — Interface to S.T.A.R.M.A.P. persistent homology for route stability scoring.
- **`smat/comms/`** — Entropy-weighted propagation and link budget calculator.
- **`smat/visualization/`** — Mission path overlay on cosmic topographical maps.
- **`smat/symbolic/`** — Integration with the S.T.A.R. symbolic regression engine for on-the-fly law discovery.

### Data Flow
1. Load projected arithmetic point cloud $\(\{\Phi(E)\}\)$ and entropy field from **S.T.A.R.M.A.P.**
2. Compute local weights along candidate trajectories (density, topological stability, entropy gradient).
3. Optimize trajectory using hybrid numeric-symbolic methods.
4. Generate risk and communication reports.
5. Visualize in interactive 3D environment.

### Integration with S.T.A.R.M.A.P.
S.M.A.T. consumes topographical maps produced by S.T.A.R.M.A.P. and returns mission-specific annotations (optimal paths, risk heatmaps, communication blackouts) back into the cosmic model.

## Current Implementation Status

- **Core Trajectory Engine**: Early prototype in `src/smat/`.
- **Integration with Projection & TDA**: Basic hooks implemented via `src/pipeline/`.
- **Hubble-Aware Propagation**: Partial support through $\(H_{\rm eff}(z)\)$ module.
- **Visualization**: Early Blender and Matplotlib-based rendering.
- **Notebooks**: `notebooks/smat_prototype.ipynb` for initial testing.

## Development Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Current – 2026)**: Basic trajectory propagation with $\(H_{\rm eff}(z)\)$, integration with S.T.A.R.M.A.P. maps.  
**Phase 2 (2026–2027)**: Full optimization with topological routing and comms analysis.  
**Phase 3 (2027+)**: GPU acceleration, GMAT interoperability, public web interface for mission scenario exploration.  
**Phase 4**: Application to real missions (e.g., interstellar precursor concepts) and contribution to open spaceflight tools.

## Broader Implications

S.M.A.T. represents a paradigm shift: mission design informed by the deepest mathematical structures of the cosmos. By embedding arithmetic-symbolic physics into practical tools, the S.T.A.R. Program moves from pure theory toward enabling humanity’s long-term exploration and settlement of the solar system and beyond.

**S.T.A.R.M.A.P. + S.M.A.T.** together close the loop from fundamental number theory to operational spaceflight.
